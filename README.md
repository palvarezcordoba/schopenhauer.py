# Schopenhauer.py
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) 

Security auditing tool, module-based, similar to [lynis](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis), but developed with python and enthusiasm.

## Advice
This project is in no active development, soon at [@OSPG](https://github.com/OSPG) we will do a Golang version.
Also, both master and develop branches are very unstable, and bug are frequently present. **But you can learn new things with this random project, and it is funny. :D**

## Why did you do it?
It occurred to someone, there was no reason not to do it and it seemed fun.

### Prerequisites

That is all. :)

If you execute it (as root) you will see something like:
